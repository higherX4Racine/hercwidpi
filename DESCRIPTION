Description: Work with files downloaded from the Wisconsin Department of Public
  Instruction. The basic action is to parse annual text files and wrangle them
  into tidy multi-year tables. There are utilities for summarizing -- by area,
  agency, or demographic grouping. Additional tools use percentiles to compare
  across otherwise incompatible test results.
